This library provide an mathematical expression parser. 
It is particularly usefull for configuration files used in simulations, for
example.

Installation
Issue the following command in the local directory:
$make all
This should create a libmathexpr.so.1.0 file in the local 'lib' directory.

In order to properly install the library you will have to:
    - create the two directories (if non existent) /opt/include and /opt/lib
    - issue 'make install' as root in the local directory
    - add '/opt/lib' to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environnement variable:
        $export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If the library is successfully installed you should be able to compile and run a
small example program:
$make test
$./test

The library is called libmathexpr.so and the corresponding header file is
expression.h.

Clean the project
Issue the following command:
$make clean
to remove the temporary build objects, and:
$make uninstall
to remove the header and library from your computer.
