This library provide an option parser to read command line options and
configuration files.
It is particularly usefull for configuration files used in simulations, for
example.

Installation
Issue the following command in the local directory:
$make all
This should create a liboptions.so.1.0 file in the local 'lib' directory.

In order to properly install the library you will have to:
    - create the two directory (if non existent) /opt/include and /opt/lib
    - issue 'make install' as root in the local directory
    - add '/opt/lib' to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environnement variable:
        $export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If the library is successfully installed you should be able to compile and run a
small example program:
$make test
$./test

The library is called liboptions.so and the corresponding header file is
common.h.

Remove
Issue:
$make clean
to remove the temporary build objects, and:
$make uninstall
to remove the header and library from your computer.
